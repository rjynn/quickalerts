Quick Alerts!
===========
This is a prototype of the an app we have designed in Management Information Systems class. 
This app is meant to crowd-source information about potential breakouts of the Ebola virus. Our system will plot these on maps and perform algorithms that will determine which areas are at high risk for Ebola breakouts. The app will inform any users of the app of breakouts in their immediate area (or in other areas according to their user settings). 

Future considerations include partnering with hospitals and clinic deployment companies so that reaction times for breakouts are faster and more efficient.
